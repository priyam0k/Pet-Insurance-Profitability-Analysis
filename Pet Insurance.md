### **Project Title: Pet Insurance Profitability Analysis: A Ratemaking and Reserving Study**

**1\. Business Problem:**

A hypothetical insurer, "Pawtect Insurance," wants to launch a new pet insurance product. The company needs to establish a profitable pricing structure and estimate the required reserves for future claims. This project will develop a comprehensive actuarial analysis to address these needs.

**2\. Dataset:**

A synthetic dataset of 10,000 pet insurance policies has been generated. The data includes the following fields:

* policy\_id: Unique identifier for each policy  
* pet\_age: Age of the pet in years  
* pet\_breed: Breed of the pet (e.g., Labrador, Poodle, Mixed)  
* location: Geographic location of the policyholder  
* coverage\_level: Level of coverage (Basic, Standard, Premium)  
* annual\_premium: The annual premium for the policy  
* claims\_incurred: The total amount of claims incurred during the policy year  
* claim\_status: The status of the claim (Paid, Outstanding)  
* policy\_year: The year the policy was active

**3\. Project Objectives:**

* **Ratemaking Analysis:**  
  * Develop a risk-based pricing model to determine appropriate premiums.  
  * Identify key rating factors that influence claim frequency and severity.  
  * Propose a new, more profitable premium structure.  
* **Reserving Analysis:**  
  * Estimate the ultimate losses for the block of business.  
  * Calculate the required reserves for both paid and outstanding claims.  
  * Use the chain-ladder method to project future claim development.

**4\. Methodology & Analysis:**

**Part A: Ratemaking Analysis**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  * Analyze the distribution of claims by pet\_breed, pet\_age, and location.  
  * Visualize the relationship between annual\_premium and claims\_incurred.  
  * Calculate the loss ratio for different segments of the business.  
* **Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for Pricing:**  
  * Develop a GLM to model claim frequency and severity separately.  
  * Use pet\_age, pet\_breed, and location as predictor variables.  
  * The model will help quantify the risk associated with each rating factor.  
* **Proposed Premium Structure:**  
  * Based on the GLM results, develop a new set of rating factors.  
  * Propose a new premium for each policy that reflects its risk profile.  
  * Calculate the projected profitability of the new premium structure.

**Part B: Reserving Analysis**

* **Loss Development Triangles:**  
  * Create loss development triangles to track how claims develop over time.  
  * Separate triangles for paid and incurred losses.  
* **Chain-Ladder Method:**  
  * Use the chain-ladder method to project the ultimate losses for each accident year.  
  * Calculate the age-to-age development factors.  
  * Estimate the Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) reserves.  
* **Reserve Estimation:**  
  * Calculate the total required reserves, including both IBNR and outstanding claims.  
  * Analyze the adequacy of the current reserves.

**5\. Tools and Technologies:**

* **Programming Languages:** Python (with pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels) and R  
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau  
* **Modeling:** Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Chain-Ladder Method

**6\. Expected Outcomes & Business Impact:**

* A new, data-driven pricing structure that improves profitability by 15%.  
* A more accurate estimate of required reserves, ensuring the company's solvency.  
* A comprehensive report and presentation for senior management, outlining the findings and recommendations.  
* A repeatable and scalable analytical framework that can be used for future product development.

**7\. Next Steps & Recommendations:**

* Implement the proposed premium structure and monitor its performance.  
* Integrate external data sources (e.g., veterinary cost inflation) to enhance the models.  
* Develop a more sophisticated reserving model that incorporates claim-level data.
